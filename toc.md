# Table of contents

This is rough draft things that I'd like to know about Elasticsearch. It's a live document, it will change throughout the journey.

- [How to launch Elasticsearch locally](launch-locally.md)
- [What is index, document, document type](what-is-what.md)
- [How to create a document](create-document.md)
- How to search
- Aggregations
- Grouping
- Cluster info
- [Endpoints cheatsheet](endpoints.md)
