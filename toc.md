# Table of contents

This is rough draft things that I'd like to know about Elasticsearch. It's a live document, it will change throughout the journey.

- [How to launch Elasticsearch locally](launch-locally.md)
- What is index, document, document type
- How to create a document
- How to search
- Aggregations
- Grouping
- Cluster info
- [Endpoints cheatsheet](endpoints.md)
